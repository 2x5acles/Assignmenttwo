Tokunbo Lawal about me page. For this about me page I chose a simple design inspired by the US army website. The website uses large "Army Style" fonts and a basic layout. Tunkunbo is in 
 the US army. Her favorite colors are blue and black hence why I chose them. Tunkunbo emphasized symplicity as to why I chose a very user friendly simple design.
